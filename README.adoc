Analyses tweets in realtime to figure out the most popular hashtags.

Uses https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark] and a https://github.com/spark-packages/dstream-twitter[Twitter DStream] to
retrieve top 5 tweets in a sliding window of 5 minutes. This result is stored in a JSON file and a small JS app is
producing a small website of this data.

Everything is included into one Docker container together with Nginx. Just run

    ./gradlew buildImage

To use the Spark module alone, build it like so:

    ./gradlew :spark:shadowJar

Optionally you can change the default path of the result JSON file by setting the environment variable
`RESULT_FILENAME`.

    export RESULT_FILENAME=/tmp/analytic.json

Finally submit the "fat jar" to your Spark for execution:

    spark-submit --class "cz.zee.mrtweety.analytic.spark.Application" --master local[4] build/libs/spark-all.jar
